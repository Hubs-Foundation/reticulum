# Hubs Server API
Reticulum includes a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API that grants programmatic access to server resources. 

Note: This API is currently in alpha testing and is not yet available for use. (Users cannot generate API Access Tokens.)

## Accessing the API
Hubs Cloud administrators can enable or disable the API by toggling `App Settings > Features > Public API Access` in the admin panel. 

Once enabled, the API can be accessed by sending HTTP `GET` and `POST` requests to `<your_hubs_cloud_host>/api/v2_alpha/`. 

## Authentication and Authorization
You must attach an API Access Token with each request.

To attach an API Access Token to a request, add an `HTTP` header named `Authorization` with value `Bearer: <your API token>`. 

### API Access Token Types
There are two types of API Access Tokens: 
- `:account` tokens act on behalf of a specific user
- `:app` tokens act on behalf of the Hubs Cloud itself

### Scopes
Each API Access Token specifies its `scopes`. Scopes allow a token to be used to perform specific actions.

| Scope | API Actions |
| --:            |         --- |      
| `read_rooms` | `myRooms`, `favoriteRooms`, `publicRooms` |
| `write_rooms` | `createRoom`, `updateRoom` |

Scopes, actions, and token types are expected to expand over time.

## Examples
Reticulum ships with [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql#graphiql), a graphical, interactive, in-browser GraphQL IDE that makes it easier to test and learn the API. It can be accessed by navigating to `<your_hubs_cloud_host>/api/v2_alpha/graphiql`. 

[This example workspace](../test/api/v2/graphiql-workspace-2020-12-07-15-26-56.json) demonstrates several queries and can be loaded into the GraphiQL interface. You will have to supply your own API access token(s).

Requests can also be sent by
- an `HTTP` client library, 
- a command line tool like `curl`, 
- a GraphQL-specific client library, or
- any other tool that speaks `HTTP`.
